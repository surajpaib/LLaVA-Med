**Output Example**: An example of the output from the get_conv_log_filename function could be: "/path/to/logs/2023-10-05-conv.json", where "/path/to/logs/" is the value of LOGDIR, and the date corresponds to the current date when the function is executed.
## FunctionDef get_model_list
**get_model_list**: The function of get_model_list is to retrieve and return a sorted list of available models from a specified controller URL.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The get_model_list function is designed to interact with a remote controller service to fetch a list of models. It first sends a POST request to the controller's "/refresh_all_workers" endpoint to ensure that all worker processes are up-to-date. The function asserts that the response status code is 200, indicating a successful request. Following this, it sends another POST request to the "/list_models" endpoint to retrieve the current list of models in JSON format. The models are extracted from the JSON response and sorted based on their priority, which is determined by a predefined priority mapping. If a model does not have an associated priority, it retains its original position in the list. The sorted list of models is then logged for informational purposes and returned as the output of the function.

This function is called by the load_demo_refresh_model_list function, which is responsible for handling requests to refresh the model list in a user interface context. When load_demo_refresh_model_list is invoked, it logs the client's IP address and calls get_model_list to obtain the latest models. The returned list is then used to update a dropdown menu in the user interface, allowing users to select from the available models. This demonstrates the integration of get_model_list within the broader application, facilitating dynamic updates to the model selection based on the current state of the controller.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the controller URL is correctly configured in the application settings, as this function relies on it to communicate with the model management service.

**Code Description**: The load_demo_refresh_model_list function is designed to facilitate the dynamic updating of the model selection in a user interface, specifically within a Gradio application. Upon invocation, it first logs the client's IP address for tracking purposes. This is achieved through the logger.info method, which captures the request.client.host attribute.

Next, the function calls get_model_list(), a separate function responsible for retrieving a sorted list of available models from a specified controller URL. This function ensures that the model list is current by sending a POST request to refresh all worker processes before fetching the list of models. The models are then sorted based on their priority and returned to the calling function.

Following the retrieval of the model list, the function creates a copy of a default conversation state using the copy method from the Conversation class. This ensures that the state is reset to its default configuration, allowing for a fresh start in the conversation context.

The function then prepares an update for a dropdown menu component in the Gradio interface by utilizing the gr.Dropdown.update method. It sets the choices of the dropdown to the list of models obtained earlier and selects the first model as the default value if the list is not empty. If the list is empty, it sets the value to an empty string.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the updated conversation state and the dropdown update object, which will be used to refresh the user interface accordingly.

This function is called within the build_demo function, specifically when the model list mode is set to "reload." This integration allows the user interface to dynamically refresh the model options available for selection, ensuring that users always have access to the latest models.

**Code Description**: The add_text function is designed to handle the addition of user-generated text and images to a conversation state within a Gradio web server context. It begins by logging the client's IP address and the length of the input text for monitoring purposes. 

The function first checks if both the text and image inputs are empty. If so, it sets the state to skip the next processing step and returns the current state along with a series of unchanged buttons. This ensures that no further action is taken when there is no input.

Next, if moderation is enabled (as indicated by the args.moderate flag), the function calls the violates_moderation function to check if the provided text violates content policies. If the text is flagged, the state is again set to skip the next step, and a moderation message is returned to the user, preventing the processing of inappropriate content.

The function then enforces a hard cut-off on the length of the text, limiting it to 1536 characters. If an image is provided, the text length is further restricted to 1200 characters, and the function ensures that the text includes a placeholder for the image. The text and image are then combined into a tuple for processing.

If there are existing images in the conversation state, the function creates a copy of the default conversation to reset the state. The function then appends the user message (text and image) to the conversation history, followed by a placeholder for the assistant's response. Finally, it resets the skip_next flag to allow for normal processing in subsequent interactions and returns the updated state along with the formatted chatbot messages and button states.

The add_text function is invoked by the build_demo function, specifically when the user submits text through a textbox or clicks a submit button. This integration allows for real-time updates to the conversation state and ensures that user inputs are processed correctly within the Gradio interface.

**Code Description**: The http_bot function is designed to facilitate interaction between a user and a chatbot by processing incoming requests and generating appropriate responses based on the selected model. It begins by logging the client's IP address and capturing the start timestamp for performance tracking.

The function first checks if the conversation state indicates that the next response should be skipped due to invalid inputs. If so, it yields the current state and a chatbot representation without making any changes.

Next, the function determines the appropriate template for the conversation based on the selected model. It handles various model names, including "llava," "mpt," and "llama-2," and sets the template accordingly. This template is then used to create a new state for the conversation, appending the user's last message.

The function proceeds to query the worker address responsible for generating responses by sending a POST request to a specified controller URL. If no worker is available, it updates the last message in the state with an error message and yields the current state.

Following this, the function constructs a prompt for the model using the current state and retrieves any images associated with the conversation. It processes these images, saving them to a specified directory if they do not already exist.

The function then prepares the payload for the model request, including parameters such as the model name, prompt, temperature, top_p, max_new_tokens, and images. It logs this payload for debugging purposes.

The state is updated to indicate that a response is being generated, and the function attempts to stream the model's output by sending a request to the worker's generate stream endpoint. It processes the response in chunks, updating the conversation state with the output as it arrives. If an error occurs during this process, it updates the state with an error message.

Finally, the function logs the conversation details, including timestamps and the state, to a log file for future reference. This logging is crucial for maintaining a record of interactions, which can be useful for debugging and improving the chatbot's performance.

The http_bot function is called by various components within the project, specifically in the build_demo function, where it is linked to user interactions such as submitting text or clicking buttons.
