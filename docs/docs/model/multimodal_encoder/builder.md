## FunctionDef build_vision_tower(vision_tower_cfg)
**build_vision_tower**: The function of build_vision_tower is to create and return an instance of the CLIPVisionTower model based on the provided configuration.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· vision_tower_cfg: This parameter is a configuration object that contains settings and paths related to the vision tower model to be built. It can include attributes like 'mm_vision_tower' or 'vision_tower'.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that may be passed to the CLIPVisionTower constructor for further customization.

**Code Description**: The build_vision_tower function is responsible for initializing a CLIPVisionTower instance, which is a model designed to process images and extract features using the CLIP architecture. The function first attempts to retrieve the vision tower path from the provided configuration object, checking for the attribute 'mm_vision_tower' and falling back to 'vision_tower' if necessary. 

It then verifies whether the specified vision tower path exists on the filesystem using `os.path.exists()`. If the path is valid (i.e., it exists, or it starts with recognized prefixes such as "openai" or "laion"), the function proceeds to create an instance of CLIPVisionTower, passing the vision tower path and the configuration arguments along with any additional keyword arguments.

This function is called within the LlavaMetaModel class during its initialization process. Specifically, if the configuration object has an attribute 'mm_vision_tower', the build_vision_tower function is invoked with this configuration, allowing for the dynamic loading of the vision tower model based on the user's settings. The resulting vision tower instance is then assigned to the LlavaMetaModel's 'vision_tower' attribute, enabling the model to utilize the vision capabilities provided by the CLIPVisionTower.

The build_vision_tower function thus serves as a critical component in setting up the multimodal capabilities of the LlavaMetaModel, ensuring that the appropriate vision model is loaded and ready for use in processing images.

**Note**: When using the build_vision_tower function, ensure that the specified vision tower path is correctly set in the configuration object and that the model is accessible. The function is designed to handle both absolute paths and recognized model names, facilitating flexible model loading.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the build_vision_tower function could be an instance of CLIPVisionTower, which is ready to process images and extract features. For instance, it may return an object that can be used to call methods like `forward()` to obtain image features.
