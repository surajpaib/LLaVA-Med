## FunctionDef load_pretrained_model(model_path, model_base, model_name, load_8bit, load_4bit, device_map, device)
**load_pretrained_model**: The function of load_pretrained_model is to load a pretrained language model and its associated tokenizer, configuring them for use based on specified parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model_path: A string representing the path to the pretrained model directory.  
· model_base: A string representing the base model name, which may be used for loading additional configurations or weights.  
· model_name: A string representing the name of the model being loaded, which influences the loading behavior and configuration.  
· load_8bit: A boolean flag indicating whether to load the model in 8-bit precision. Default is False.  
· load_4bit: A boolean flag indicating whether to load the model in 4-bit precision. Default is False.  
· device_map: A string indicating how to map the model to devices, with "auto" as the default setting.  
· device: A string specifying the device to load the model onto, defaulting to "cuda".

**Code Description**: The load_pretrained_model function is responsible for loading a pretrained model and its tokenizer, with specific configurations based on the provided parameters. It begins by initializing an empty dictionary, kwargs, to store configuration options for loading the model.

The function checks the specified device; if it is not "cuda", it sets the device mapping accordingly. It also checks the flags for loading the model in 8-bit or 4-bit precision. If load_4bit is set to True, it configures additional parameters related to quantization using the BitsAndBytesConfig class.

The function then determines whether to load a LLaVA model or a standard language model based on the model_name. If the model_name contains "llava", it proceeds to load the LlavaMistralForCausalLM model, which is specifically designed for multimodal processing. In this case, it initializes the tokenizer and loads the model with the specified configurations.

If the model_name does not indicate a LLaVA model, the function checks if a model_base is provided. If so, it loads a PEFT model, initializes the tokenizer, and merges the LoRA weights from the model_path. If model_base is not provided, it loads the model directly from the model_path, with special handling for models containing "mpt" in their name.

The function also handles the initialization of an image processor if the model is a LLaVA model. It checks the model's configuration for specific attributes related to image processing and adjusts the tokenizer's vocabulary accordingly.

Finally, the function retrieves the maximum sequence length from the model's configuration or defaults to 2048 if not specified. It returns the initialized tokenizer, model, image processor, and context length for further use in the application.

This function is called in various parts of the project, including the eval_model function in llava/eval/model_vqa.py and the main function in llava/serve/cli.py. In these contexts, load_pretrained_model is utilized to prepare the model and tokenizer for evaluation or inference tasks, ensuring that the necessary components are correctly configured and ready for use.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the model_path and model_base parameters point to valid directories and models to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, the configuration passed to the model should adhere to the expected structure to ensure proper functionality.

**Output Example**: A possible output from the load_pretrained_model function could be a tuple containing the tokenizer, model, image processor (if applicable), and the maximum context length, such as:
(tokenizer_instance, model_instance, image_processor_instance, 2048)
