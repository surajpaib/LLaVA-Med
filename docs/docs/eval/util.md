## FunctionDef load_file_jsonl(path)
**load_file_jsonl**: The function of load_file_jsonl is to read a JSON Lines formatted file and return its contents as a list of dictionaries.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· path: A string representing the file path to the JSON Lines file that needs to be read.

**Code Description**: The load_file_jsonl function opens a specified file located at the given path and reads its contents line by line. Each line is expected to be a valid JSON object. The function utilizes the json.loads method to parse each line into a Python dictionary. The result is a list of these dictionaries, which can then be utilized for further processing. 

This function is called in two different contexts within the project. In the first instance, within the main function of llava/eval/eval_multimodal_chat_gpt_score.py, load_file_jsonl is used to load answer data and question data from specified files. The data is then processed to create a list of samples that are passed to an inference function. This demonstrates the utility of load_file_jsonl in preparing data for evaluation tasks.

In the second instance, within the main function of llava/eval/summarize_gpt_review.py, load_file_jsonl is used to read scores data from a file. The loaded data is then analyzed to compute various statistics, such as average scores and relative scores, which are organized into a structured format for further reporting. This highlights the function's role in data extraction and preparation for analysis.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the file specified by the path parameter exists and is formatted correctly as JSON Lines. Any malformed JSON will raise an error during the loading process.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from load_file_jsonl might look like this:
[
    {"text": "What is the capital of France?", "gpt4_answer": "Paris"},
    {"text": "What is the capital of Germany?", "gpt4_answer": "Berlin"}
]
## FunctionDef get_avg(x)
**get_avg**: The function of get_avg is to calculate the average of a list of numerical values.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: x - A list of numerical values (can be integers or floats) for which the average is to be calculated.

**Code Description**: The get_avg function takes a single parameter, x, which is expected to be a list containing numerical values. The function first converts each element in the list to a float, ensuring that any integer values are appropriately handled. It then computes the sum of these float values using the built-in sum function. Finally, the function divides this total sum by the length of the list (i.e., the number of elements in x) to obtain the average. 

This function is utilized within the main function of the llava/eval/summarize_gpt_review.py file. In this context, get_avg is called multiple times to compute averages for different score types derived from a dataset loaded from a JSONL file. Specifically, it calculates the average scores for GPT-4 evaluations and predictions, as well as the average relative score between these two sets of scores. The results are then organized into a dictionary and subsequently converted into a pandas DataFrame for structured output.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input list x is not empty, as this would lead to a division by zero error when calculating the average. Proper error handling should be implemented in the calling function to manage such cases.

**Output Example**: For an input list x = [4, 5, 6], the function would return 5.0, which is the average of the numbers in the list.
