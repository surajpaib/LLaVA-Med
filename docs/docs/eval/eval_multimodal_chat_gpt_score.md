## FunctionDef conv_to_str(fig_label, fig_caption, fig_context, question, ans1, ans2)
**conv_to_str**: The function of conv_to_str is to format and return a structured string representation of a conversation context, including figure details, a question, and two answers.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: fig_label - A string representing the label of the figure.
· parameter2: fig_caption - A string that provides a caption for the figure.
· parameter3: fig_context - A string that describes the context of the figure.
· parameter4: question - A string containing the question posed in the conversation.
· parameter5: ans1 - A string representing the first answer in the conversation.
· parameter6: ans2 - A string representing the second answer in the conversation.

**Code Description**: The conv_to_str function constructs a formatted string that encapsulates various elements of a multimodal chat scenario. It begins with a context section that includes the figure label and caption, followed by the figure context. Next, it presents the question posed to the participants. The function then includes two distinct answers, each prefixed with a role identifier and concluded with an end marker. This structured output is particularly useful for generating messages that can be sent to a chat model or evaluated for quality, as it provides a clear and organized format for the conversation context.

The conv_to_str function is called within the compare_messages_gen function. In this context, it is used to create a message that encapsulates the conversation details, which is then appended to a list of messages. This list is structured to include a system message that sets the context for the assistant's role, followed by the user message generated by conv_to_str. The resulting messages can be utilized for further processing, such as evaluating the quality of the answers provided in response to the question.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that all parameters are provided with appropriate string values to maintain the integrity of the formatted output. The function assumes that the ROLE and INSTRUCT_PROMPT variables are defined elsewhere in the code, as they are used in the output string but not defined within this function.

**Output Example**: An example of the formatted string returned by conv_to_str might look like this:

```

· parameter6: ans2 - A string representing the second answer in the conversation.

**Code Description**: The compare_messages_gen function constructs a list of messages that are formatted for use in evaluating the quality of responses in a multimodal chat scenario. It begins by initializing a list called `messages` with a system message that sets the context for the assistant's role, indicating that it is a helpful and precise assistant for checking the quality of answers. 

The function then calls the conv_to_str function, passing in the parameters fig_label, fig_caption, fig_context, question, ans1, and ans2. This call generates a formatted string that encapsulates the conversation details, including the figure information, the posed question, and the two answers. The resulting string is appended to the `messages` list as a user message.

The output of compare_messages_gen is a structured list of messages that can be utilized for further processing, such as being sent to a chat model for evaluation. This function is called within the infer function, where it prepares input messages for a batch of samples. The infer function processes multiple samples, invoking compare_messages_gen for each sample to generate the necessary input for the model's evaluation of the answers provided.

**Note**: When using this function, it is essential to ensure that all parameters are provided with appropriate string values to maintain the integrity of the formatted output. The function relies on the conv_to_str function to create the user message, which must be correctly implemented to ensure accurate formatting.

**Output Example**: An example of the structured list returned by compare_messages_gen might look like this:

## FunctionDef sum_list_list(x)
**sum_list_list**: The function of sum_list_list is to calculate the total sum of all elements contained within a list of lists.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: x - A list of lists, where each inner list contains numerical values.

**Code Description**: The sum_list_list function takes a single parameter, x, which is expected to be a list containing multiple inner lists. The function utilizes a generator expression to iterate through each inner list and then through each item within those inner lists. It sums up all the items found in the inner lists and returns the total sum as a single numerical value. The use of the built-in sum function allows for efficient accumulation of the values, ensuring that the function operates in a straightforward and concise manner.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that all elements within the inner lists are numerical values (integers or floats) to avoid type errors during the summation process. If any non-numeric values are present, the function will raise a TypeError.

**Output Example**: If the input is [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]], the function will return 21, which is the sum of all the numbers in the nested lists.
## FunctionDef chunk(lst, n)
**chunk**: The function of chunk is to divide a list into smaller sublists of a specified size.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: lst - The list that needs to be divided into chunks.
· parameter2: n - The size of each chunk.

**Code Description**: The chunk function takes a list (lst) and an integer (n) as input and yields sublists of the specified size n. The function iterates over the input list in steps of n, creating slices of the list. If there are fewer than n elements remaining at the end of the list, the function will yield the remaining elements as the last chunk. The function ensures that the last chunk is returned correctly by checking if the current index plus 1.5 times n exceeds the length of the list. If it does, the end index for the current chunk is set to the length of the list, ensuring that all elements are included.

This function is utilized within the infer function, which is responsible for processing samples for a multimodal chat GPT scoring evaluation. In the infer function, the chunk function is called to create batches of input messages that are then processed by the model instance (model_inst). The use of chunking allows for efficient handling of the input data, ensuring that the model can process a manageable number of samples at a time. This is particularly important when dealing with large datasets, as it helps to optimize memory usage and processing time.

**Note**: When using the chunk function, it is important to ensure that the input list is not empty and that the chunk size (n) is a positive integer to avoid unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: For an input list lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and n = 2, the function would yield the following sublists:
- [1, 2]
- [3, 4]
- [5, 6]
## FunctionDef infer(samples)
**infer**: The function of infer is to process a list of samples and generate evaluation results using a language model.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: samples - A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains data related to a question and its corresponding answers, including figure labels, captions, and other contextual information.

**Code Description**: The infer function is designed to evaluate multiple samples by leveraging a language model, specifically an instance of the GPT class initialized with the model ID "gpt-4-0314". The function begins by setting a batch size of 1, which indicates that samples will be processed one at a time. It initializes empty lists for batch_samples and results to store the processed data.

The function prints a message indicating the start of the evaluation process. It then iterates over each sample in the provided samples list using a progress bar from the tqdm library. For each sample, it creates a deep copy to avoid modifying the original data. The function calls compare_messages_gen, passing relevant fields from the sample to generate a structured input message for the model.

As samples are processed, they are added to a batch list. Once the batch reaches the specified BATCH_SIZE, the function invokes the model's infer method to obtain evaluation results. The results are stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and are then associated with their corresponding samples by updating the 'gpt_eval' key in each sample's dictionary.

After processing all samples in the batch, the function checks if there are any remaining samples in the batch and processes them similarly. Finally, the function prints the size of the results list and returns it.

The infer function is called within the main function, which is responsible for loading question and answer data, preparing samples, and invoking infer to obtain evaluation results. The results are then written to a specified output file.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the input samples are correctly formatted and contain all necessary fields to avoid errors during processing. The function relies on the compare_messages_gen and chunk functions to prepare input messages and manage batch processing effectively.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the infer function could be a list of dictionaries, each containing the original sample data along with the generated evaluation results, such as:
```
[
    {
        "question": "What are the key steps in this process?",
        "ans1": "The key steps include identifying the problem, gathering information, and implementing a solution.",
        "ans2": "The main steps are to analyze the issue, develop a plan, and execute the solution.",
        "gpt_eval": "The answers provided are relevant, but they could be more detailed."
    },
    ...
]
```
## FunctionDef main(args)
**main**: The function of main is to load question and answer data from specified files, prepare samples for evaluation, and write the evaluation results to an output file.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· args: An object that contains the file paths for the answers, questions, and the output scores file.

**Code Description**: The main function serves as the entry point for processing evaluation data in a multimodal chat scoring context. It begins by loading answer and question data from JSON Lines formatted files using the util.load_file_jsonl function. This function reads the contents of the specified files and returns them as lists of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a single entry containing relevant data.

Once the data is loaded, the main function initializes an empty list called samples. It then iterates over the loaded question and answer data simultaneously using the zip function. For each pair of question and answer, it creates a deep copy of the question to avoid modifying the original data. The function then populates the 'question' field with the text from the question copy and assigns the GPT-4 answer from the question copy to 'ans1', while 'ans2' is populated with the text from the answer data. Each modified question dictionary is appended to the samples list.

After preparing the samples, the function calls the infer function, which processes the samples and generates evaluation results using a language model. The infer function is responsible for evaluating the samples and returning a list of results that include the original sample data along with the generated evaluation results.

Following the inference process, the main function ensures that the parent directory for the output scores file exists by using os.makedirs. It then opens the specified output file in write mode and iterates over the results obtained from the infer function, writing each result as a JSON object to the output file, one per line.

This function is crucial for orchestrating the data loading, processing, and result writing steps in the evaluation pipeline, effectively linking the data preparation with the evaluation logic encapsulated in the infer function.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the file paths provided in the args parameter are valid and that the files are formatted correctly as JSON Lines. Any issues with file accessibility or formatting may lead to errors during execution.
